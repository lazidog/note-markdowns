# React

## Basic concepts

### State and Props

| State                                                                   | Props                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| - store data within a component, rerender component everytime it change | - pass data or handler to child component |
| - mutable                                                               | - immutable                               |

### Class Component and Functional Component

| Functional Component                                            | Class Component                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| - a Jspure function that accepts props and return React element | - a class extend React Component                   |
| - stateless component                                           | - statefull component                              |
| - need React Hooks to manage state and lifecycle                | - internal methods (render, componentDidMount,...) |

## State management

### Redux

> A predictable state container to keep the consistency state across application. App state will be kept in store for any component access any state.
>
> Not directly modify the state, instead, dispatch actions that intend to change the state, and then separately, observe the resulting state changes.
>
> Redux doesn't know about async logic, it only know (dispatch actions, update the state by calling reducer, and notify the UI), any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store. `That's why Redux middleware were designed to enable writing logic that has side effects.`

### Redux Saga / Redux Thunk

`Redux Thunk` is a middleware that lets you call action creators that return a function instead of an action object. That function receives the storeâ€™s dispatch method, which is then used to dispatch regular synchronous actions inside the body of the function once the asynchronous operations have completed.

```js
export const asyncApiCall = values => {
  return dispatch => {
    return axios.get(url).then(response => {
      dispatch(successHandle(response));
    });
  };
};

export const successHandle = response => {
  return {
    // return action object
    type: SUCCESS,
    data: response.data,
  };
};
```

`Redux Saga` provide helper effect use an ES6 feature called `Generators`:

```js
const fetchPosts = payload => {
  return fetch(url)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .catch(err => {
      throw err;
    });
};

function* sagaWatcher() {
  yield takeLatest(FETCH_POSTS, fetchPostWorker);
}

function* fetchPostWorker({ payload }) {
  try {
    const data = yield call(fetchPosts, payload);
    yield put({
      type: FETCH_POSTS_SUCCESS,
      data,
    });
  } catch (err) {
    yield put({
      type: FETCH_POSTS_FAIL,
    });
  }
}
```

- takeEvery(): start a task on each action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern.
- takeLastest(): if started previously tasks is still running, they will be canceled
- put(): dispatch action.
- call(): call function

### Redux Persist

> A library that enables persisting Redux state across page reloads or app restarts
